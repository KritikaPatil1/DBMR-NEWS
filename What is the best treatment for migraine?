Migraine is a complex neurological disorder that causes recurring, intense headaches often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light or sound. It affects millions worldwide, with a significant number being women. Understanding the causes and treatment options is key to managing this debilitating condition.
Migraine Symptoms and Causes
Common migraine symptoms include throbbing pain, usually on one side of the head, aura (visual disturbances), and in some cases, nausea and vomiting. What causes migraines in females is often linked to hormonal changes, stress, sleep disorders, or dietary triggers. Women frequently experience menstrual migraines, which occur in connection with their menstrual cycle.

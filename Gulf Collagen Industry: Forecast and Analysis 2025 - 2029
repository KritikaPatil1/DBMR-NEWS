**Segments**

The Gulf collagen market is segmented based on type, source, form, and application. By type, the market is segmented into type I, type II, type III, and type IV. Type I collagen is the most abundant collagen type in the human body and is commonly used in various applications such as wound healing and tissue regeneration. Type II collagen is primarily found in cartilage, making it essential for joint health products. Type III collagen is commonly found in skin and blood vessels, playing a crucial role in maintaining skin elasticity and vascular health. Type IV collagen is a major component of the basement membrane and is essential for maintaining tissue structure and function.

Based on source, the Gulf collagen market is segmented into bovine, porcine, marine, and others. Bovine collagen is derived from cows and is widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries.
